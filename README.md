# bar_roulette_app

Final individual project for WDI McClane

Bar Roulette is an app for the times people don't know which bar to go to or if they are tired of going to the same 3 bars over and over again.  

Directions

1. First you will put in your starting location
2. Then enter the max distance in miles you are willing to travel.
3. Then choose how much you are willing to spend at a bar, which is a number between 1-4. 1 being the cheapest and 4 being most expensive. You can also choose more than one number, for example (1,2,3) or (3,4).
4. Click "Spin to Win" to see your randomly generated bar based on your search parameters.
5. The chosen bar will show you the price, a rating from 1-10, and the address.
6. If you are so inclines, you can click "Uber Estimate".  This will give you price estimates from all the different Uber cars eg.(UberXL, Uber Black, UberX, UberSUV). And also render a Google Map with the markers representing your starting location and the randomly generated bar
